# SeeFood
What if I told you there is an app on the market ... Kotlin for Android with TFLite inspired by HBO's Silicon Valley :heart:

Feel free to view the source code, read the explanation, and play around with this repository. Enjoy!

## Background
SeeFood is a food classifying app inspired by Season 4 Episode 4 of HBO's comedy television series *Silicon Valley* in which Jian Yang, an app developer, creates an app that claims to be the "Shazam of food", but only recognizes if something is a hot dog or not. :joy:

I looked around GitHub and I found a lot of cool implementations of this idea. From Swift to Python to Objective C to Dart, there were many interesting takes on Jian Yang's geniousity. However, I've yet to find one with Kotlin for Android with TFLite. Until now!

## Info
This implementation of the classic scene from the show not only captures the joke in Version 1, but also goes further with Version 2, the complete food classification feature.

## Quickstart Guide
Clone the SeeFood folder and import into Android Studio. Run on either an Android device or an emulator. Done!
