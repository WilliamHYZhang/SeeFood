SeeFood is a food classifying app inspired by Season 4 Episode 4 of HBO's comedy television series *Silicon Valley* in which Jian Yang, an app developer, creates an app that claims to be the "Shazam of food", but only recognizes if something is a hot dog or not. :joy:

This implementation of the classic scene from the show not only captures the joke in Version 1, but also goes further with Version 2, the complete food classification feature.

Feel free to view the source code, read the explanation, and play around with this repository.

Enjoy!
