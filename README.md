# SeeFood
Kotlin for Android with TFLite inspired by HBO's Silicon Valley :heart:

SeeFood is a food classifying app inspired by Season 4 Episode 4 of HBO's comedy television series *Silicon Valley* in which Jian Yang, an app developer, creates an app that claims to be the "Shazam of food", but only regonizes if something is a hot dog or not. :joy:
